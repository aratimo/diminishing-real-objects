head shoulders knees and toes
the first time he tried to swim
the aspirations of a nation
mom made her a turtleneck
a thoroughly disgusting thing to say
go out for some pizza and beer
I do not fully agree with you
where did you get such a silly idea
want to join us for lunch
he is just like everyone else
we have enough witnesses
public transit is much faster
machinery is too complicated
he called seven times
be persistent to win a strike
the fax machine is broken
please follow the guidelines
do not lie in court or else
we are subjects and must obey
prevailing wind from the east
traveling to conferences is fun
I watched blazing saddles
teaching services will help
rectangular objects have four sides
do you like to go camping
a picture is worth many words
never mix religion and politics
careless driving results in a fine
a lot of chlorine in the water
bad for the environment
the registration period is over
it looks like a shack
we missed your birthday
they might find your comment offensive
chemical spill took forever
a most ridiculous thing
on the way to the cottage
our life expectancy has increased
vanilla flavored ice cream
these cookies are so amazing
the dog will bite you
a much higher risk of getting cancer
the presidential suite is very busy
the trains are always late
the laser printer is jammed
universally understood to be wrong
irregular verbs are the hardest to learn
watch out for low flying objects
all work and no play
that is very unfortunate

find a nearby parking spot
what a monkey sees a monkey will do
exercise is good for the mind
parking lot is full of trucks
the fire raged for an entire month
get your priorities in order
dolphins leap high out of the water
the chamber makes important decisions
the stock exchange dipped
your etiquette needs some work
taking the train is usually faster
presidents drive expensive cars
goldilocks and the three bears
the minimum amount of time
the quick brown fox jumped
coming up with killer sound bites
you have my sympathy
that is a very odd question
the rationale behind the decision
sign the withdrawal slip
I am allergic to bees and peanuts
olympic athletes use drugs
space is a high priority
the pen is mightier than the sword
come and see our new car
six daughters and seven sons
I can play much better now
tickets are very expensive
please keep this confidential
starlight and dewdrop
she wears too much makeup
what to do when the oil runs dry
reading week is just about here
where did you get that tie
good jobs for those with education
this is a non profit organization
interesting observation was made
if you come home late the doors are locked
frequently asked questions
dormitory doors are locked at midnight
you are a capitalist pig
elections bring out the best
the most beautiful sunset
with each step forward
the gun discharged by accident
double double toil and trouble
quit while you are ahead
the picket line gives me the chills
the force is with you
what a lovely red jacket

peek out the window
communicate through email
drove my chevy to the levee
that is a very nasty cut
do a good deed to someone
this watch is too expensive
one of the poorest nations
jumping right out of the water
protect your environment
the children are playing
he is still on our team
accompanied by an adult
I am going to a music lesson
well connected with people
limited warranty of two years
we are having spaghetti
not quite so smart as you think
I cannot believe I ate the whole thing
a steep learning curve in riding a unicycle
a big scratch on the tabletop
a good response to the question
handicapped persons need consideration
mystery of the lost lagoon
the early bird gets the worm
please provide your date of birth
video camera with a zoom lens
put garbage in an abandoned mine
suburbs are sprawling up everywhere
the chancellor was very boring
the water was monitored daily
make my day you sucker
he was wearing a sweatshirt
if diplomacy does not work
the winner of the race
the daring young man
look in the syllabus for the course
this mission statement is baloney
very reluctant to enter
get rid of that immediately
there will be some fog tonight
prepare for the exam in advance
circumstances are unacceptable
our housekeeper does a thorough job
stiff penalty for staying out late
your presentation was inspiring
no kissing in the library
the assignment is due today
travel at the speed of light
is there any indication of this
this camera takes nice photographs

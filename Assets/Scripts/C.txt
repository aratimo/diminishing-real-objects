do not walk too quickly
three two one zero blast off
obligations must be met first
one hour is allotted for questions
faster than a speeding bullet
you must make an appointment
you will loose your voice
dashing through the snow
elephants are afraid of mice
sing the gospel and the blues
victims deserve more redress
everyone wants to win the lottery
the elevator door appears to be stuck
every Saturday he folds the laundry
companies announce a merger
I skimmed through your proposal
one never takes too many precautions
a dog is the best friend of a man
learn to walk before you run
I listen to the tape everyday
completely sold out of that
the store will close at ten
sharp cheese keeps the mind sharp
seasoned golfers love the game
fish are jumping
the back yard of our house
call for more details
a rattle snake is very poisonous
where can my little dog be
that agreement is rife with problems
life is but a dream
question that must be answered
my fingers are very cold
if at first you do not succeed
please take a bath this month
the price of gas is high
parking tickets can be challenged
all good boys deserve fudge
neither a borrower nor a lender be
the generation gap gets wider
a duck quacks to ask for food
motivational seminars make me sick
wishful thinking is fine
can we play cards tonight
great disturbance in the force
most judges are very honest
we must redouble our efforts
do not feel too bad about it
salesmen must make their monthly quota
that sticker needs to be validated
